## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was a refresher on basic frontend concepts that I had learnt and used at work as a frontend engineer. This included:

- using flexbox
- CSS custom properties to set the colors

### Continued development

While I was able to complete this mini-challenge without much trouble, there are still room for improvement:

- I would like to get better at the usage of padding and gaps
- Gain more experience referencing Figma models
- Recognizing redundant css styles
